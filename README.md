# Manual-Testing-Project
These are the Manual Testing projects which I have worked on

1.VWO application:

VWO is the market-leading A/B testing tool that fast-growing companies use for experimentation & conversion rate optimization.

A/B testing, also known as split testing, refers to a randomized experimentation process wherein two or more versions of a variable (web page, page element, etc.) are shown to different segments of website visitors at the same time to determine which version leaves the maximum impact and drives business metrics.

I have attached test plan,test cases for app.vwo.com and bug report.
